# Weather app

Goals
You should fetch data from the API using fetch() in JavaScript
The app should have: city name, current temperature, weather description, sunrise/sunset time, 4-day forecast
The presentation of the data should be in the specified format
Make the page fully responsive so that it works well on mobile as well as tablet and desktop (make it look good on devices from 320px width up to 1600px)

## View it live
[Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.](https://weatherappjw.netlify.app/)
